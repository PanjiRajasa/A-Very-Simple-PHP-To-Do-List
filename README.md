# A-Very-Simple-PHP-To-Do-List
This is a super duper very simple to-do list that was made by using PHP. It uses simple session, simple auth, PDO, simple MySQL database, dan I have given comments to all code. But eveything is in Indonesia, so you might need to translate it into English. Do not forget to configure the server name based on your current server 😉
